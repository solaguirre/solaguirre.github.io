## Description

This is the start of my professional portfolio. I have included an About Me page, a Portfolio page displaying the projects I worked on a student. 

What you will see here is a functional application with working links and responsive images. The Nav bar is consistent on each page, and has links that let you navigate between the pages. The portfolio has my personal information, including a link to my resume and an an additional external teacher porfolio.
