## About Me
The name Marisol means Ocean and Sun in Spanish. I feel that my name has a huge significance in my life. My name has shaped my personality, the duality there really describes me as a person. I like to bring light to people's life with a smile, humor or a shoulder to cry on. Sometimes I'm also like water, free flowing, gentle at times, strong and resilient. I like to go through life bringing joy, I have had the opportunity to this in my life as an educator. 

My journey as a creative person has only just begun. I hope to be able to bring my identity and optimism to my projects.
